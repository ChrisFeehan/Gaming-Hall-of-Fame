# Gaming-Hall-of-Fame
A simple website project to get more comfortable with collaboration, version control and basic webpage design.

## Outline
This project will be a webpage, with primarily static content, featuring 3-5 favorite games from the past and present.

## Learning Goals

1. Use Git and Github to control versioning and collaborate remotely
2. Use templating (EJS) to ease design of multiple web pages with similar content
